Liquor Cabinet is an app to keep track of your inventory of booze.
It also tracks your intake of liquor and projects what you will need more of.
From this information, it generates a shopping list of what you will need to buy and when.
It should let you know a week in advance that you might run out of something.

There will be a tray icon to quickly add things consumed.
There should be a couple submenus like:
Ingredients, Drinks
Where each one has a list of ingredients and drinks on hand, sorted by popularity.
In the main menu, there will be a quicklist of favorite ingredients, and a list of favorite drinks.
1oz, 4oz, 8oz, 16oz, 32oz

Could also have a "Drunk Mode" where you can just click on huge buttons with what's been used lately.
Maybe also a drunk test that asks math questions to determine if you should really have another shot.

Normal and Party Mode.
Normal is 1oz portions, party is by 4oz.
Larger portions in party mode.

We can use http://demo.vmspython.org/pyhtmldoc/sympy.physics.units.html to convert units.

The "drink" part is just a shortcut for a group of ingredients and how much.

Should have a splash screen on first run, as well as bringing the gui up by default.
Should also die when ctrl+c'd

Money Making Scheme:
There's the open source version, and then the Premium version.
The Premium version has the nagging about having too much to drink optionally disabled.
It also keeps track of who paid for it and shows so in the about window.
Premium users also get Premium support (direct email line with me.)
Open Source users get "community support" (still me.)
Premium users also get put in the credits as supporters if they want.
The Premium version is still GPL'd.
